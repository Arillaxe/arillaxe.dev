- Reduced pressure on the blockchain nodes by collaborating on the creation of
  a crawler service (communicated with blockchain nodes via gRPC and parsed
  blockchain transactions into a PostgreSQL database).
- A strong contributor to efforts for frontend and backend services including
  authentication (authorization across multiple projects), administration
  (user permissions), and API key management.
- Aided development of a smart contract called EAST which is a native stable
  coin for the public blockchain (TypeScript, Nest.js) that was subsequently
  rewritten to utilize a JS SDK.
- Facilitated seamless logins across different subdomains without
  reauthentication by implementing a domain-wide authorization system.
- Enabled more efficient project management by using an Agile Scrum methodology
  for development and collaboration.
